# SpecialChar

## Synopsis

A C# project to help people to type special characters by long pressing keys on their keyboard.
On OSX systems, if I want to type a special character, for example Ã¤, I will just hold the A key on my beyboard until I get a list of possible special characters on screen.
This project does exactly the same, but on Windows.
